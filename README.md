# Device scene generator

This repository is to help developers create framed screenshoots to showcase their apps. You have to options to do it:
 - [Device scene generator lib](https://github.com/9and3r/device_scene_generator/tree/gh-pages/lib)
 - [Device scene generator web](http://9and3r.github.io/device_scene_generator/device_scene_generator/device_scene_editor.html)
 
## Device scene generator lib

You can use the lib directly to showcase your app in the web. Once the setup is done you can change the screenshoots without creating the images manually. 

You can also use it to make dynamic images ([Example of dynamic images](http://live-tracking.appspot.com/en/index.jsp)). You can see in the example that the devices and screens of the app are changing dinamycally. You can [check the code here] (http://live-tracking.appspot.com/js/device_images_generator.js) 

## Device scene generator web

[This website](http://9and3r.github.io/device_scene_generator/device_scene_generator/device_scene_editor.html) allows to generate images to showcase your inside device frames. Some device frames taken from [device art generator](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html) are included but you can upload your own frames. 

I recomend using [the ones provided from facebook](http://facebook.design/devices) as it look great (I contacted them to include them by default but I have not received the response yet).
